# Naked Dashboard

> Naked Dashboard removes all dashboard widgets, with exceptions.

Made at the request of SÃ© Reed on [WP Watercooler EP386](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDxX5NW7a_4), a weekly WordPress podcast.

## Installation

1. Download the ZIP.
1. Extract the folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`.

or

```sh
cd /wp-content/plugins/
git clone https://github.com/Brugman/we-use-cookies.git
```

## Update

1. Download the new ZIP.
1. Replace the old folder in `/wp-content/plugins/`.

or

```sh
cd /wp-content/plugins/we-use-cookies/
git pull

By default only the Site Health metabox remains. To remove this metabox, or keep others, edit the `$exceptions` array in the PHP file.

If you customize the exceptions, keep in mind that an update will reset these.
